## Abstract
We present an improved semantic search approach based on a weighted TF-IDF method and the BERT natural language model. We motivate the choice of a weighted TF-IDF method via an intuition that the questionable spans in a document summarize the document's topics and hence, should be placed greater emphasis when calculating the TF-IDF score. The use of the BERT natural language model is to complement the weakness of the TF-IDF framework in understanding the true semantic meaning of a document. Therefore, our model encodes a document's questionable spans and true semantics. It scales effectively in the size of the dataset. In a number of semantic search experiments on question-answering datasets, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional models by a significant margin.
